### Project Abstract
Corrosion is estimated to account for over 20 billion dollarsâ€™ worth of maintenance parts and
labor each year in the Department of Defense. The Maintenance and Availability Data
Warehouse (MADW) was developed to improve understanding of the corrosion problem,
seeking to inform corrosion policy and funding decisions at the highest levels. Critical to our
understanding of the corrosion problem is identification of the object receiving maintenance in
each record, as well as identification of corrosion-related maintenance and supply transactions.
In most cases, the unstructured text entries of the MADW provide the most information for these
tasks. The purpose of this research is two-fold: to estimate the accuracy of the MADW objects
identification algorithm and to identify ways to improve the corrosion tagging algorithm used in
the MADW through use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) unsupervised and supervised
deep learning algorithms. The first implication of this research is that expert systems need not be
supplanted by deep learning methods at the expense of interpretability, instead, expert systems
can be updated and improved by deep learning. Secondly, improving the algorithms that run on
the MADW data is beneficial to improving the quality of insights gained from the data. Finally,
this research identifies that a key future research area is improvement of data quality through
improved data collection and cleaning techniques.
